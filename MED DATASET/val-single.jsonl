Loss of parietal cell markers (H+/K+ ATPase) confirms autoimmune gastritis-related parietal cell destruction, correlating with the clinical history.\n\n3. **Diagnostic Integration** – The combination of a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma arising amid autoimmune gastritis with intestinal metaplasia, positive resection margins, and regional nodal metastases confirms advanced gastric carcinoma of intestinal type. The absence of necrosis and extracapsular nodal extension may suggest a moderately indolent course, but the presence of nodal metastases necessitates further oncologic management.\n\n**Summary:** A well-differentiated intestinal-type adenocarcinoma arising in autoimmune gastritis with submucosal invasion, positive margins, and metastatic perigastric nodes confirms advanced gastric carcinoma requiring additional therapeutic intervention."}
